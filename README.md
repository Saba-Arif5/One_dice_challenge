# One Dice Challenge

This Python script implements a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die. 

**Game Rules:**

1. **Players:** 2-4 players can participate in the game.
2. **Objective:** Each player aims to accumulate points by rolling a die.
3. **Gameplay:**
   - In each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they wish.
   - The score of each roll is added to the player's current turn score.
   - If the player rolls a "1", their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated in that turn.
   - The player can choose to "hold" their current turn score at any time.
4. **Winning:** The player with the highest score when any player reaches a target score of 20 points wins the game.

**How to Play:**

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the number of players (between 2 and 4).
3. Each player takes turns rolling the die.
4. Enter "y" to roll again or "n" to hold their current score.
5. The game continues until one player reaches the target score.
6. The winner is announced.

**To Run:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dice_game.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the command: `python dice_game.py`

**Note:**

- This is a basic implementation of the game. You can further enhance it by adding features like:
    - Allowing players to choose the target score.
    - Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).
    - Adding more complex game rules.

I hope this README file is helpful!
